title: "Message from UC President Janet Napolitano"
---

Colleagues,

I write to share some exciting news.

The Board of Regents has just approved Dr. Cynthia K. Larive as the eleventh chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. Currently the provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, she has served the UC community for nearly a decade and a half as a faculty member, administrator and leader.

I believe the breadth and scope of Dr. Larive's academic credentials and knowledge, combined with her incredible dedication and passion for UC, make her the ideal visionary to lead UC Santa Cruz.

[You can read more about her in our press release](/announcements/ucop/).

I also want to take a moment to thank Chancellor George Blumenthal for his strong leadership over the past 12 years. He leaves behind a legacy of academic excellence and a staunch commitment to UC's public mission.

While this is a bittersweet moment for all of us, George has more than earned his retirement after a career with UC that spanned 47 years!

Please join me in congratulating Dr. Larive in her new role as chancellor, effective July 1, and Chancellor Blumenthal in his well-deserved retirement.

Yours very truly,  
Janet Napolitano
