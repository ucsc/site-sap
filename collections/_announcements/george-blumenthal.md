I am delighted to see the appointment of Cindy Larive, campus provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Riverside, as our new chancellor. I invite you to [watch this video of Cindy that was just put together by our campus communications team!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YcTctiMrZw)

I am extremely happy not only for Cindy, but for our campus community. Cindy brings impeccable academic credentials, strong leadership skills, and a track record of expanding educational access and student success. Like so many of our students, Cindy is a first-generation college student, and she understands the ability of higher education to open doors and expand opportunities.

Having spoken with her, it's clear that she values what we do as well: academic excellence, campuswide collaboration, and building a diverse community.

I look forward to interacting closely with Cindy as she learns more about our campus before the baton is officially passed at the end of June. Please join in me in welcoming Cindy to UC Santa Cruz!

Fiat Slug!
