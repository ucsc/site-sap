            <span style="font-weight: 400;">To: UC Santa Cruz community<br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp<br /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re: Exciting times ahead for Strategic Academic Plan</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">It is our community’s brilliant, insightful work that has led us this far in our strategic academic planning. Your astute insights and feedback will continue to shape the future of this university. Leadership of the process has transitioned to Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Herbie Lee.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We write to provide an update on the three elements of the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">draft plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the evolving implementation plan. </span><b></b>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Barrier Reduction. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our community was clear about the need to reduce internal obstacles to our innovative work. We are committed to tackling the areas you identified as barriers. Work launches this fall on two of the 10 high-priority barriers: </span>
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Team-teaching difficulties, and,</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving grant proposal procedures and faculty/ researcher support from the Office of Sponsored Projects. </span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">We are planning to address the other items and remain committed to working on them over the next several years.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Academic Priority Areas. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three academic priority areas are at the core of how we will focus our academic renewal and growth, and how we will present our programs externally. We will center next year’s faculty hires around the academic priority areas, from the request for plans from the deans this fall to the decisions made next spring.  We have worked with our colleagues to develop </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7WDilQXrisEMUb7AicK7qPCLoZXmbznb0Sc3PrB9jw/edit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed descriptions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of these APAs.  </span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Design Principles. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are awaiting feedback from our Academic Senate and other campus academic leadership on our proposed design principles, and how they should be prioritized. We anticipate a broader conversation this year with faculty, staff, and students on how best to define and embody these principles.</span>
          </p>
          
          <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive research and creative work that transform our world.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Create enriching experiential learning and research opportunities for students.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage and support a diverse faculty, staff, and student body.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Support generative interdisciplinary connections to research and teaching.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;">
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">Expand excellence in innovation in areas distinctive to UC Santa Cruz, such as social justice, diversity, and sustainability.</span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            <b>Café SAP: Save the Date! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPAA Lee will host pop-up office hours for faculty, staff, and students to discuss the SAP. The first will be 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 10, at the Music Center patio. Monthly pop-ups will move around campus. Our Coastal Science Campus and Scotts Valley location also will host pop-ups. Dates and locations will be shared as they become available. I plan to join Herbie on occasion to hear directly from the campus community. We invite all who are interested to come, to ask questions, or to simply share thoughts and comments. </span>
