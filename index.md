“UC Santa Cruz has the capacity to take a greater role on the international stage: to lead with our cutting-edge scholarship, to offer new strategies for engaged and ethical pedagogy, and to provide a visionary model for public higher education – qualities that honor and advance our founding mission. We can extend our impact and inspire not only California and its citizens, but the whole world.”
