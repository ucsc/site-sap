## Overview of SAP

Aspiration alone does not guarantee achievement. Prestigious universities routinely design bold plans for the future, but many fall short because they are not linked to concrete and realistic implementation plans and have no input from faculty, students, and staff. Furthermore, their institutional goals and aspirations are often solidified without sufficient research into resources, needs, organizational capacity, or current and emerging academic trends.

 To ensure that the vision of UC Santa Cruz for its future can be made real, Entangled Solutions linked each design principle to a concrete goal that is tied to a menu of possible initiatives and outcomes.

 The difference between goals and initiatives should be noted. Strategic goals are direction-setting, outcome-based aspirations. Initiatives, on the other hand, are concrete steps taken in pursuit of a goal. Initiatives are actionable and specific, bridging the gap between desired outcome and execution. Good initiatives provide clear steps to achieve goals.

  Key outcomes are metrics that enable the monitoring of progress toward specific, defined objectives. By assessing outcomes we ensure that initiatives and, ultimately goals are realized. UC Santa Cruz chose to utilize multi-factored variables to capture a wide array of progress toward initiatives.

Selected data sources for tracking progress may include:

* Citations and IP licenses
* Faculty retention rates
* Graduation rates
* Graduate employment statistics
* Graduate pursuing graduate school statistics
* Experiential research opportunities
* Cross-collaborative research statistics
* Interdisciplinary grant applications
* Number of cross-listed courses

This action-oriented structure paves the way for continuous improvement, allowing UC Santa Cruz to quickly identify the most important initiatives, the community members who need to be involved, and the desired outcome for each initiative.
