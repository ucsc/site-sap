During the planning process and after considerable consultation across campus, ten institutional barriers that were perceived to impede our capacity to do our best research, teaching, and learning were identified. Four (see asterisks&#42;) were selected for study and barrier reduction:

1. &#42; Design effective mechanisms to support joint appointments.
2. &#42; Reduce team-teaching difficulties.
3. Optimize space assignment and utilization practices.
4. &#42; Improve grant proposal procedures and faculty/researcher support from the Office of Sponsored Projects.
5. Align incentives and support for faculty to generate extramural resources.
6. &#42; Improve integration of Silicon Valley and main campus programs.
7. Improve (internal and external) information sharing.
8. Address risk-averse institutional culture.
9. Address general lack of administrative staff support.
10. Develop a consistent philosophy of teaching load expectations across departments and divisions.

Over time, additional barriers may be targeted for study and reduction.
