Part of the strategic planning process involved identifying institutional barriers to research, teaching, and learning. Faculty, students, and staff responded with hundreds of examples, from the structural challenges that hinder team teaching and the lack of funding to support graduate students, to the lack of incentives to support faculty in generating external funding.

The campus community, Academic Senate, and Academic Advisory Committee, each provided their assessments of the barriers to the Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor, who ultimately charged the Implementation Working Group with studying, and making recommendations for reducing or eliminating, the 10 most immediate campus barriers. It is our expectation that additional barriers will be targeted for study and elimination over the five years of the plan.

**1.** Design effective mechanisms to support joint appointments

**2.** Reduce team-teaching difficulties

**3.** Optimize space assignment and utilization practices

**4.** Improve grant proposal procedures and faculty/researcher support from the Office of Sponsored Projects

**5.** Align incentives and support for faculty to generate extramural resources

**6.** Improve integration of Silicon Valley and main campus programs

**7.** Improve (internal and external) information sharing

**8.** Address risk-averse institutional culture

**9.** Address general lack of administrative staff support

**10.** Develop a consistent philosophy of teaching load expectations across departments and divisions
